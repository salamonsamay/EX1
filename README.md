* This task was about to continig the first task that was to Perform calculation operations between polynom ad monom.
in this task we create objet with the name complexfction the represent arryslist of type y=g(f1(x), f2(x)),
 where both f1, f2 are functions (or complex functions), 
y and x are real numbers and g is an operation: plus, mul, div, max, min, comp (f1(f2(x))).

* we also need to display the functions on graf.
